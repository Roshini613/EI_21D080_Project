This Java program demonstrates the Template Method design pattern to streamline the order processing system. 
It features an abstract OrderProcessor class that defines a template method processOrder, ensuring a consistent sequence of steps: validating the order, collecting customer details, calculating the total, preparing shipping, and delivering the order. 
Concrete classes PhysicalGoodsOrder, DigitalGoodsOrder, and SubscriptionOrder extend OrderProcessor, each implementing the unique specifics of their respective order types. 
Users simply select the order type and provide details, showcasing the Template Method pattern's flexibility and efficiency in creating a robust, customizable order processing experience. This approach highlights the pattern's ability to handle diverse processes dynamically, making the system both practical and sophisticated.
