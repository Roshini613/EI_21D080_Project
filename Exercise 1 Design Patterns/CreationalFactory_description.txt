This Java program demonstrates the Factory Method design pattern to manage electronic components dynamically. 
It features an ElectronicComponent interface with implementations for Resistor, Capacitor, and Transistor, each encapsulating specific properties and behaviors. 
Abstract and concrete factory classes are used to instantiate these components. 
The ComponentManagementService class uses these factories, providing a user-friendly experience where users select a component type and input specific values, leading to the dynamic creation and management of the component. 
This approach showcases the Factory Method pattern's flexibility in efficiently handling diverse objects, making the code both practical and sophisticated.
